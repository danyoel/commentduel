# NIMBY Ninja

In Seattle and many cities, the public comment process becomes a one-sided place. Special interest groups rally to make public comments appear overwhelmingly single-sided. Their views are not necessarily representative of the community. *commentduel* aims to present a one single public comment at a time, and allow a citizen to respond to that single comment.

The code in [/web](https://github.com/danyoel/commentduel/tree/master/web) runs at http://nimby.ninja.
